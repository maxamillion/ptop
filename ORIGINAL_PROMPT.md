# Original Prompt that started this whole thing

Write a product requirements docuemnts and a plan to implement a new command line
linux system monitoring tool named ptop, that is similar to top, htop, glances, and btop.
Specifically this one should be written in python, utilizing the textual framework
to develop the terminal user interface, and manage the project using the uv utility
and make use of python virtual environments to develop and test. Primary metrics to target
for the system monitor are cpu, memory, storage, i/o wait, recent log errors, and
anything else that would be important to a linux systems administration professional.
