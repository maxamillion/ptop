# Product Requirements Document: ptop

## Executive Summary
ptop is a modern, Python-based system monitoring tool designed for Linux systems administrators. Built with the Textual framework, it provides real-time system metrics in an intuitive terminal user interface, combining the functionality of traditional tools like top, htop, and glances with enhanced features tailored for modern system administration needs.

## Product Overview

### Vision
Create a comprehensive, user-friendly system monitoring tool that provides Linux administrators with essential system insights in a single, efficient terminal interface.

### Mission
Deliver real-time system monitoring capabilities through a modern Python application that is easy to install, configure, and extend.

## User Stories

### Core Monitoring
1. As a sysadmin, I want to see real-time CPU usage so I can identify performance bottlenecks
2. As a DevOps engineer, I want to monitor memory usage to prevent OOM conditions
3. As an SRE, I want to track disk I/O to diagnose storage performance issues

### Process Management
4. As a sysadmin, I want to view running processes sorted by resource usage
5. As a DevOps engineer, I want to kill runaway processes from the interface
6. As an SRE, I want to see process relationships in a tree view

### System Health
7. As a sysadmin, I want to see recent system errors so I can proactively address issues
8. As a DevOps engineer, I want configurable alerts for threshold breaches
9. As an SRE, I want to export metrics for integration with monitoring systems

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- PyPI download counts
- GitHub stars and forks
- Community contributions

### Performance Metrics
- Application startup time <2 seconds
- UI responsiveness <100ms lag
- Memory footprint <50MB

### User Satisfaction
- Positive feedback in issue tracker
